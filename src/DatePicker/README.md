# DatePicker

`<datePicker/>` relies on [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v1.29.0/docs/I18n) for localization.
Default locale is English, it can be changed via `locale` prop. It also possible to setup additional locales from [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v1.29.0/docs/I18n) by passing them through `locales` prop.
